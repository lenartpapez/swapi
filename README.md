# swapi

A simple Vue app for browsing the Star Wars API. You can select one of three categories for which you can fetch paginated data. Clicking on entities will open up a modal with more details. You can add entities to your list of favorites and it will persist across sessions. A simple search is also supported.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
